# TASK 1.1
*Write your own code for simulating from the posterior distribution of f using the squared
exponential kernel. The function (name it posteriorGP) should return a vector with
the posterior mean and variance of f, both evaluated at a set of x-values. You
can assume that the prior mean of f is zero for all x. The function should have the
following inputs: <br />

- X: Vector of training inputs.<br />
- y: Vector of training targets/outputs.<br />
- XStar: Vector of inputs where the posterior distribution is evaluated.<br />
- sigmaNoise: Noise standard deviation.<br />
- k: Covariance function or kernel. That is, the kernel should be a separate function.*

over the interval x E [-1, 1]. Plot also 95 % probability (pointwise) bands for f.*

the posterior mean of f over the interval x E [-1, 1]. Plot also 95 % probability (pointwise) bands for f.
Hint: Updating the posterior after one observation with a new observation gives the
same result as updating the prior directly with the two observations

# TASK 1.4
*Compute the posterior distribution of f using all the five data points in the table below
(note that the two previous observations are included in the table). Plot the posterior
mean of f over the interval x E [-1, 1]. Plot also 95 % probability (pointwise) bands for
f. <br />

y 0.768 -0.044 -0.940 0.719 -0.664 <br />
*
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Observations: 
X = c(-1.0, -0.6, -0.2, 0.4, 0.8)
Y = c(0.768, -0.044, -0.940, 0.719, -0.664)

posterior2 = posteriorGP(X, Y, XStar, sigmaNoise = 0.1, SquaredExpKernel, sigmaf = sigmaf, ell = ell)
plotPosterior(posterior2$posteriorMean, posterior2$posteriorVariance, X, Y, XStar)
```

# TASK 1.5
*Repeat (4), this time with hyperparameters sigmaf = 1 and ell = 1. Compare the results.*

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
X = c(-1.0, -0.6, -0.2, 0.4, 0.8)
Y = c(0.768, -0.044, -0.940, 0.719, -0.664)
ell = 1

posterior2 = posteriorGP(X, Y, XStar, sigmaNoise = 0.1, SquaredExpKernel, sigmaf = sigmaf, ell = ell)
plotPosterior(posterior2$posteriorMean, posterior2$posteriorVariance, X, Y, XStar)

```

As expected, we see that this posterior over f is much smoother than the one in the task before. This is since we use a ell = 1 instead of ell = 0.3. The posterior with ell = 0.3 seems to resemble the few data points we have, however, depending on how the real distribution looks like, this model could be overfitted. The posterior with ell = 1 looks like it is underfitted when looking at the data points we have. 

# TASK 2.1 
*Create the variable time which records the day number since the start of the dataset (i.e.,
time= 1, 2, . . ., 365 × 6 = 2190). Also, create the variable day that records the day number
since the start of each year (i.e., day= 1, 2, . . ., 365, 1, 2, . . ., 365). Estimating a GP on 2190
observations can take some time on slower computers, so let us subsample the data and use
only every fifth observation. This means that your time and day variables are now time= 1, 6,
11, . . ., 2186 and day= 1, 6, 11, . . ., 361, 1, 6, 11, . . ., 361.*
<br /> <br />

*Define your own square exponential kernel function (with parameters ell and sigmaf
(sigmaf)), evaluate it in the point x = 1, x' = 2, and use the kernelMatrix function
to compute the covariance matrix K(X, Xstar) for the input vectors X = T(1, 3, 4) and
Xstar = T(2, 3, 4).

# TASK 2.4
*Consider first the following model:*

![Model](C:\Users\gusta\Desktop\Studier\TDDE15\Lab 4\eq2.png)

*Estimate the model using the squared exponential function with sigmaf = 20 and ell = 0.2.
Superimpose the posterior mean from this model on the posterior mean from the model
in (2). Note that this plot should also have the time variable on the horizontal axis.
Compare the results of both models. What are the pros and cons of each model?*

       pch=c(-1,-1,-1,19), lwd=c(2,2,2,0))



```

The pros with the model from (2) is that it takes temperature readings in close time proximity into account. This leads to the model being able to catch time periods that are particularly cold or warm compared to the same time period other years. The model from (4), which is shown by the blue line could however be better when predicting for years in the future if we assume that there is no trend in temperature that covers multiple years (what is global warming even??). If we have this assumption, the red line would wrongly predict cold temperatures for a coming year if the year previously was cold. In conclusion, the model that is best for future predictions depends on what assumptions we have on the data.

The variances for both the models seems to be somewhat similiar. 


# TASK 2.5
* Finally, implement a generalization of the periodic kernel given in the lectures:*

![Model](C:\Users\gusta\Desktop\Studier\TDDE15\Lab 4\eq3.png)

*Note that we have two different length scales here, and ell2 controls the correlation between the same day in different years. Estimate the GP model using the time variable
with this kernel and hyperparameters sigmaf = 20, ell1 = 1, ell2 = 10 and d = 365/sd(time).
The reason for the rather strange period here is that kernlab standardizes the inputs to have standard deviation of 1. Compare the fit to the previous two models (with
sigmaf = 20 and ell = 0.2). Discuss the results.*

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
periodicKernel <- function(sigmaf = 1, ell1 = 1, ell2 = 1, d) 
{
  rval <- function(x, y = NULL) {
    r = crossprod(x-y);
    exp1 = exp(-2*(sin(pi*sqrt(r)/d)**2)/ell1**2)
    exp2 = exp(-0.5*r*(ell2**2))
    return((sigmaf**2)*exp1*exp2)
  }
  class(rval) <- "kernel"
  return(rval)
  
}
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

lmFit = lm(tempSubset ~ time + time**2) 
noise = sd(lmFit$residuals) 

# Creating kernel with sigmaf = 20, ell = 0.2
sigmaf = 20
ell1 = 1
ell2 = 10
d = sd(time)
kernel = periodicKernel(sigmaf = sigmaf, ell1 = ell1, ell2 = ell2, d)

#
fitGP = gausspr(x = time, 
                y = tempSubset, 
                kernel = kernel, 
                var = noise**2)
meanPredictPer = predict(fitGP, time)

plot(time, tempSubset, type = "l")
lines(time, meanPredict, col = "red", lwd = 2)
lines(time, meanPredictDay, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
lines(time, meanPredictPer, col = "green", lwd = 2)
legend("bottomright", 
       legend=c("time", "day", "periodic"),

       pch=c(-1,-1,-1,19), lwd=c(2,2,2,0))

```

The perodic model, shown by the green line, seems to be fitting the data in the best way. One reason for this could be that this model, unlike the model in (4) and (2), takes into account that the data should be periodic but stills looks at readings in close time proximity. 

# TASK 3.1
*Use the R package kernlab to fit a Gaussian process classification model for fraud
on the training data. Use the default kernel and hyperparameters. Start using only
the covariates varWave and skewWave in the model. Plot contours of the prediction
probabilities over a suitable grid of values for varWave and skewWave. Overlay the
training data for fraud = 1 (as blue points) and fraud = 0 (as red points). You can reuse
code from the file KernLabDemo.R available on the course website. Compute the
confusion matrix for the classifier and its accuracy.*

confusionMatrix = table(predict(GPfit,trainingData[,1:4]), trainingData[,5]) # confusion matrix
confusionMatrix
accuracy = sum(diag(confusionMatrix)) / sum(confusionMatrix)
accuracy
```

# TASK 3.2
* Using the estimated model from (1), make predictions for the test set. Compute the
accuracy.*

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
prediction = predict(GPfit, testingData)
confusionMatrix = table(prediction, testingData[,5]) # confusion matrix
confusionMatrix
accuracy = sum(diag(confusionMatrix)) / sum(confusionMatrix)
accuracy

```

The resulting accuarcy on the test set is the same as on the training set, however we can see that the confusion matrix has changed.

# TASK 3.3
*Train a model using all four covariates. Make predictions on the test set and compare
the accuracy to the model with only two covariates.*

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
GPfit = gausspr(fraud ~  varWave + skewWave + kurtWave + entropyWave, data=trainingData)

prediction = predict(GPfit, testingData)
confusionMatrix = table(prediction, testingData[,5]) # confusion matrix
confusionMatrix
accuracy = sum(diag(confusionMatrix)) / sum(confusionMatrix)
accuracy


```

Here we see that we get almost a hundred percent accuarcy when using all four covariates to make the predictions.
